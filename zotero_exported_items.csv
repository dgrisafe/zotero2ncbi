The resulting 12-item short-form (SF-12) achieved multiple R squares of 0.911 and 0.918 in predictions of the SF-36 Physical Component Summary and SF-36 Mental Component Summary scores, respectively. Scoring algorithms from the general population used to score 12-item versions of the two components (Physical Components Summary and Mental Component Summary) achieved R squares of 0.905 with the SF-36 Physical Component Summary and 0.938 with SF-36 Mental Component Summary when cross-validated in the Medical Outcomes Study. Test-retest (2-week)correlations of 0.89 and 0.76 were observed for the 12-item Physical Component Summary and the 12-item Mental Component Summary, respectively, in the general US population (n=232). Twenty cross-sectional and longitudinal tests of empirical validity previously published for the 36-item short-form scales and summary measures were replicated for the 12-item Physical Component Summary and the 12-item Mental Component Summary, including comparisons between patient groups known to differ or to change in terms of the presence and seriousness of physical and mental conditions, acute symptoms, age and aging, self-reported 1-year changes in health, and recovery for depression. In 14 validity tests involving physical criteria, relative validity estimates for the 12-item Physical Component Summary ranged from 0.43 to 0.93 (median=0.67) in comparison with the best 36-item short-form scale. Relative validity estimates for the 12-item Mental Component Summary in 6 tests involving mental criteria ranged from 0.60 to 107 (median=0.97) in relation to the best 36-item short-form scale. Average scores for the 2 summary measures, and those for most scales in the 8-scale profile based on the 12-item short-form, closely mirrored those for the 36-item short-form, although standard errors were nearly always larger for the 12-item short-form.","1996-03","2020-06-04 02:43:18","2020-06-04 02:43:18","","220-33","","3","34","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/","*Health Status; *Health Surveys; *Mental Health; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Regression Analysis; Reproducibility of Results; United States/epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Binocular visual field impairment was calculated from simultaneous Esterman visual field testing using the Humphrey automated perimeter. Visual acuity impairment, defined with the American Medical Association's Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment; visual functioning, measured with the VF-14 and the field test version of the National Eye Institute-Visual Functioning Questionnaire; and global quality of life, assessed with the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, were determined in 147 consecutive patients with glaucoma. None of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey domains demonstrated more than a weak correlation with visual field impairment. The VF-14 scores were moderately correlated (r = -0.58). Of the National Eye Institute-Visual Functioning Questionnaire scales, peripheral vision (r = -0.60), distance activities (r = -0.56), and vision-specific dependency (r = -0.56) were moderately correlated with visual field impairment; vision-specific social functioning, near activities, vision-specific role difficulties, general vision, vision-specific mental health, color vision, and driving were modestly correlated with visual field impairment (r value between -0.32 and -0.55); visual pain was weakly correlated with visual field impairment; and general health and vision-specific expectations were not notably correlated with visual field impairment. Statistically adjusting for visual acuity weakened the correlations. The Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey indicated that our patients with glaucoma were comparable with previously studied patients without severe systemic medical problems. However, the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey scores did not correlate with visual field impairment in our study. Based on the moderate correlation between binocular visual field impairment with the VF-14 and the National Eye Institute-Visual Functioning Questionnaire, these questionnaires may be useful among patients with glaucoma.","1997-11","2020-06-04 02:43:17","2020-06-04 02:43:17","","1447-55","","11","115","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","","","; ","https://escholarship.org/content/qt1wr1z4f4/qt1wr1z4f4.pdf; http://dx.doi.org/","Adult; Humans; Middle Aged; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Male; Visual Acuity/*physiology; Visual Field Tests; *Quality of Life; Adolescent; Health Surveys; Surveys and Questionnaires; Visual Fields/*physiology; Glaucoma/*physiopathology/psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey of eye disease with retrospective collection of falls data. SETTING: Two postcode areas in the Blue Mountains west of Sydney, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: All people 49 years of age and older were invited to participate, 3654 (82.4%) of 4433 eligible residents took part, and 3299 answered questions about falls. MEASUREMENTS: Subjects had a detailed eye examination and answered questions about health and vision status, use of medication, and number of falls in the previous 12 months. RESULTS: Tests of visual function that had a statistically significant association with two or more falls after adjustment for confounders were visual acuity (prevalence ratio (PR) 1.9 for visual acuity worse than 20/30), contrast sensitivity (PR 1.2 for a 1-unit decrease at 6 cycles per degree), and suprathreshold visual field screening (PR 1.5 for 5 or more points missing). However, only visual acuity and contrast sensitivity were significantly associated with two or more falls per 1 standard deviation decrease. The presence of posterior subcapsular cataract (PR 2.1) and use of nonmiotic glaucoma medication (PR 2.0) had a statistically significant association with two or more falls; presence of age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and cortical or nuclear cataract did not. CONCLUSION: Visual impairment is strongly associated with two or more falls in older adults. In addition to poor visual acuity, visual factors such as reduced visual field, impaired contrast sensitivity, and the presence of cataract may explain this association.","1998-01","2020-06-04 02:43:16","2020-06-04 02:43:16","","58-64","","1","46","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","","","; ","https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.libproxy2.usc.edu/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1532-5415.1998.tb01014.x; http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-5415.1998.tb01014.x","Accidental Falls/*statistics & numerical data; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cataract/complications; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Glaucoma/complications; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Poisson Distribution; Proportional Hazards Models; Vision Disorders/*complications/diagnosis; Visual Acuity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: In a prospective study, frequency doubling technology perimetry (C-20 full threshold) was performed in the right eye of 254 normal control subjects and 230 patients with early (n = 85), moderate (n = 114), or advanced (n = 31) glaucomatous visual field loss. Previous Humphrey Field Analyzer test results were used to classify glaucomatous visual field loss as early (mean deviation no worse than -6 dB), moderate (mean deviation between -6 and -12 dB) or advanced (mean deviation between -12 and -22 dB). RESULTS: Receiver operating characteristic curves showed 100% sensitivity and specificity (area under the curve, 1.0) for detecting advanced glaucomatous visual field loss, approximately 96% sensitivity and 96% specificity (area under the curve, 0.9751) for detecting moderate glaucomatous visual field loss, and approximately 85% sensitivity and 90% specificity (area under the curve, 0.9261) for early glaucomatous visual field loss.

This fifth edition of Health Measurement Scales enables these groups to both develop scales to measure non-tangible health outcomes, and better evaluate and differentiate between existing tools. Health Measurement Scales is the ultimate guide to developing and validating measurement scales that are to be used in the health sciences. The book covers how the individual items are developed; various biases that can affect responses (e.g. social desirability, yea-saying, framing); various response options; how to select the best items in the set; how to combine them into a scale; and finally how to determine the reliability and validity of the scale. It concludes with a discussion of ethical issues that may be encountered, and guidelines for reporting the results of the scale development process. Appendices include a comprehensive guide to finding existing scales, and a brief introduction to exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, making this book a must-read for any practitioner dealing with this kind of data.","2015","2020-06-04 02:42:03","2020-06-04 02:42:03","","","","","","","","","","","","","Oxford University Press","Great Clarendon Street, Oxford, United Kingdom","","","","","","","","","","","https://books.google.com/books/about/Health_Measurement_Scales.html?id=JH3OBAAAQBAJ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","5th","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design Retrospective analysis of population- and clinic-based samples of adults. Participants A total of 490 SEE and 7053 glaucoma clinic subjects with VF loss (MD ≤−3 decibels [dB] in at least 1 eye). Methods Visual field testing was performed in each eye, and IVF MD was calculated. Differences between better-eye and IVF MD were calculated for SEE and clinic-based subjects. In SEE subjects with VF loss, models were constructed to compare the relative impact of better-eye and IVF MD on driving habits, mobility, self-reported vision-related function, and reading speed. Main Outcome Measures Difference between better-eye and IVF MD and relationship of better-eye and IVF MD with performance measures. Results The median difference between better-eye and IVF MD was 0.41 dB (interquartile range [IQR], −0.21 to 1.04 dB) and 0.72 dB (IQR, 0.04–1.45 dB) for SEE subjects and clinic-based patients with glaucoma, respectively, with differences of ≥2 dB between the 2 MDs observed in 9% and 18% of the groups, respectively. Among SEE subjects with VF loss, both MDs demonstrated similar associations with multiple ability and performance metrics as judged by the presence/absence of a statistically significant association between the MD and the metric, the magnitude of observed associations (odds ratios, rate ratios, or regression coefficients associated with 5-dB decrements in MD), and the extent of variability in the metric explained by the model (R2). Similar associations of similar magnitude also were noted for the subgroup of subjects with glaucoma and subjects in whom better-eye and IVF MD differed by ≥2 dB. Conclusions The IVF MD rarely differs from better-eye MD, and similar associations between VF loss and visual disability are obtained using either MD. Unlike better-eye MD, IVF measurements require extra software/ calculation. As such, information from studies using better-eye MD can be more easily integrated into clinical decision-making, making better-eye MD a robust and meaningful method for reporting VF loss severity.","2013-12","2020-05-03 23:17:17","2020-11-18 20:20:56","2020-05-03 23:17:17","2476-84","","12","120","","Ophthalmology","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 23993358 PMCID: PMC3834089","","/Users/domusc/Zotero/storage/A8DTHZPC/Arora et al. - 2013 - The Relationship between Better-Eye and Integrated.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3834089/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Participants in the fourth round of a population-based study, the Salisbury Eye Evaluation, were examined. The main outcome measure was glaucoma, based on optic nerve damage and visual field loss or obvious glaucomatous optic neuropathy without an available, reliable, reproducible visual field. RESULTS: A total of 1250 individuals (95.9% of those eligible) participated, 1233 (98.6%) of whom agreed to screening and an eye examination. The prevalence (95% confidence interval) of open-angle glaucoma was 3.4% (0.5%-6.4%) for white individuals aged 73 and 74 years, increasing to 9.4% (7.4%-11.5%) for those 75 years and older. There was no increasing prevalence in those older than 75 years. Among black persons, the prevalence (95% confidence interval) was 5.7% (0%-11.9%) in those aged 73 and 74 years and 23.2% (17.8%-28.5%) in those 75 years and older.

METHODS: Review of published scientific articles and unpublished research findings. RESULTS: Cataract, AMD, open-angle glaucoma, DR, and visual impairment prevalences are high in four different studies of these conditions, especially in people over 75 years of age. There are disparities among racial/ethnic groups with higher age-specific prevalence of DR, open-angle glaucoma, and visual impairment in Hispanics and blacks compared with whites, higher prevalence of age-related cataract in whites compared with blacks, and higher prevalence of late AMD in whites compared with Hispanics and blacks. The estimates are based on old data and do not reflect recent changes in the distribution of age and race/ethnicity in the United States population. There are no epidemiologic estimates of prevalence for many visually-impairing conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Ongoing prevalence surveys designed to provide reliable estimates of visual impairment, AMD, age-related cataract, open-angle glaucoma, and DR are needed.

Objective To determine the demographic and geographic variations in VI and blindness in adults in the US population in 2015 and to estimate the projected prevalence through 2050 Design Descriptive Setting Population-based cross-sectional Participants Pooled data from adults, 40 years and older, from six major population-based studies on VI and blindness in the US. Prevalence of VI and blindness were reported by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and per capita prevalence by state, using the US census projections (2015 – 2050). Main Outcome and Measures Prevalence of VI and blindness Results In 2015, 1.02 million people were blind, and approximately 3.22 million people in the US had VI (best-corrected VA in the better-seeing eye), while up to 8.2 million people had VI due to uncorrected refractive error. By 2050, the number of these conditions are projected to double to approximately 2.01 million people with blindness, 6.95 million people with VI, and 16.4 million with VI due to uncorrected refractive error. The highest numbers of these conditions are predicted among non-Hispanic whites, women, and older adults, however African Americans are projected to experience the highest prevalence of blindness. By 2050, the highest prevalence of VI among minorities will shift from African Americans to Hispanics. From 2015-2050, the states projected to have the highest per-capita prevalence of VI are Florida and Hawaii and highest projected per-capita prevalence of blindness are Mississippi, Louisiana, and Florida. Conclusion & Relevance These data suggest that vision screening for refractive error and early eye disease may reduce or prevent a high proportion of individuals from experiencing unnecessary vision loss and blindness, decrease associated costs to the US economy for medical services and lost productivity, and contribute to better quality of life. Targeted education and screening programs for non-Hispanic white women and minorities should become increasingly important due to the projected growth of these populations and their relative contribution to the overall numbers of these conditions.","2016-07-01","2020-04-07 19:11:06","2020-04-07 19:11:27","2020-04-07 19:11:05","802-809","","7","134","","JAMA Ophthalmol","Visual Impairment and Blindness in Adults in the United States","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 27197072 PMCID: PMC5116104","","/Users/domusc/Zotero/storage/2IFVAIWV/Varma et al. - 2016 - Visual Impairment and Blindness in Adults in the U.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5116104/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Prospective, observational cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: The study included 236 patients with glaucomatous visual field loss followed for an average of 4.3+/-1.5 years. METHODS: All subjects had the 25-item National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25) performed annually and standard automated perimetry (SAP) at 6-month intervals. Subjects were included if they had a minimum of 2 NEI VFQ-25 and 5 SAP tests during follow-up. Evaluation of rates of visual field change was performed using 4 different regions (central inferior, central superior, peripheral inferior, and peripheral superior) of the integrated binocular visual field. The association between change in NEI VFQ-25 Rasch-calibrated scores and change in different regions of the visual field was investigated with a joint multivariable longitudinal linear mixed model. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The relationship between change in QoL scores and change of mean sensitivity in different regions of the visual field. RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between change in the NEI VFQ-25 Rasch scores during follow-up and change in different regions of the visual field. Each 1 decibel (dB)/year change in binocular mean sensitivity of the central inferior area was associated with a decline of 2.6 units/year in the NEI VFQ-25 scores (R(2) = 35%; P < 0.001). Corresponding associations with change in QoL scores for the peripheral inferior, central superior, and peripheral superior areas of the visual field had R(2) values of 30%, 24%, and 19%, respectively. The association for the central inferior visual field area was statistically significantly stronger than those of the central superior area (P = 0.011) and peripheral superior area (P = 0.001), but not the peripheral inferior area (P = 0.171). Greater declines in NEI VFQ-25 scores were also seen in patients who had worse visual field sensitivity at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: Progressive decline in sensitivity in the central inferior area of the visual field had the strongest association with longitudinal decline in QoL of patients with glaucoma.","2016-03","2019-03-21 19:57:56","2019-03-21 19:57:56","","552-7","","3","123","","Ophthalmology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","26704883","NLM","","","","","","*Visual Fields; Humans; Middle Aged; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Male; Visual Field Tests; Disease Progression; Sickness Impact Profile; Surveys and Questionnaires; Longitudinal Studies; Sensitivity and Specificity; Prospective Studies; Vision Disorders/*diagnosis; Glaucoma/*psychology; Quality of Life/*psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Baseline VFQ-25 data from 240 participants with diabetic macular edema from a randomized, double-masked, multicenter clinical trial were used to evaluate the VFQ at the total score level. CTT, RMT, and IRT evaluations were conducted, and results were assessed in a head-to-head comparison. RESULTS: Results were similar across the three methods, with IRT and RMT providing more detailed diagnostic information on how to improve the scale. CTT led to the identification of two problematic items that threaten the validity of the overall scale score, sets of redundant items, and skewed response categories. IRT and RMT additionally identified poor fit for one item, many locally dependent items, poor targeting, and disordering of over half the response categories. CONCLUSIONS: Selection of a psychometric approach depends on many factors. Researchers should justify their evaluation method and consider the intended audience. If the instrument is being developed for descriptive purposes and on a restricted budget, a cursory examination of the CTT-based psychometric properties may be all that is possible. In a high-stakes situation, such as the development of a patient-reported outcome instrument for consideration in pharmaceutical labeling, however, a thorough psychometric evaluation including IRT or RMT should be considered, with final item-level decisions made on the basis of both quantitative and qualitative results.","2015-01","2019-03-21 19:57:49","2019-03-21 19:57:49","","25-34","","1","18","","Value in health : the journal of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research","","","","","","","","eng","","","","25595231","NLM","","","","/Users/domusc/Zotero/storage/2DZJBQEJ/Petrillo-2015-Using-classical-test-theory-item-re (1).pdf","","*Patient Outcome Assessment; classical test theory; Diabetic Retinopathy/diagnosis/epidemiology; Humans; item response theory; Macular Edema/diagnosis/epidemiology; patient-reported outcome; psychometrics; Psychometrics/methods/standards; Rasch measurement theory; Self Report/*standards; Surveys and Questionnaires/*standards","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: We recruited 322 eyes of 161 patients with glaucomatous visual field loss from the Diagnostic Innovations Glaucoma Study followed for an average of 3.5+/-0.7 years. METHODS: All subjects had National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI VFQ)-25 performed annually and standard automated perimetry (SAP) at 6-month intervals. Subjects were included if they had a minimum of 2 NEI VFQ-25 and >/=5 SAP during follow-up. Evaluation of rates of visual field change was performed using the mean sensitivity (MS) of the integrated binocular visual field (BVF). Rasch analysis was performed to obtain final scores of disability as measured by the NEI VFQ-25. A joint longitudinal multivariate mixed model was used to investigate the association between change in NEI VFQ-25 Rasch-calibrated scores and change in BVF sensitivity. Potentially confounding socioeconomic and clinical variables also were analyzed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The relationship between change in NEI VFQ-25 Rasch-calibrated scores and change in binocular SAP MS. RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between change in the NEI VFQ-25 Rasch scores during follow-up and change in binocular SAP sensitivity. Each 1-dB change in binocular SAP MS per year was associated with a change of 2.9 units per year in the NEI VFQ-25 Rasch scores during the follow-up period (R(2) = 26%; P<0.001). Eyes with more severe disease at baseline were also more likely to have a decrease in NEI VFQ-25 scores during follow-up (P<0.001). For subjects with the same amount of change in SAP sensitivity, those with shorter follow-up times had larger changes in NEI VFQ-25 scores (P = 0.005). A multivariable model containing baseline and rate of change in binocular MS had an adjusted R(2) of 50% in predicting change in NEI VFQ-25 scores. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline severity, magnitude, and rates of change in BVF sensitivity were associated with longitudinal changes in QoL of glaucoma patients. Assessment of longitudinal visual field changes may help to identify patients at greater risk for developing disability from the disease.","2015-02","2019-03-21 19:57:46","2019-03-21 19:57:46","","293-301","","2","122","","Ophthalmology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","25444345","NLM","","","","","","*Visual Fields; Humans; Middle Aged; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Male; Visual Field Tests; Follow-Up Studies; Disease Progression; Surveys and Questionnaires; Cohort Studies; Visual Acuity/physiology; Sensitivity and Specificity; Prospective Studies; Vision, Binocular/physiology; *Sickness Impact Profile; Intraocular Pressure/physiology; Quality of Life/*psychology; Vision Disorders/diagnosis/*psychology; Disability Evaluation; Glaucoma/diagnosis/*psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 5186 participants in the 2005 through 2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 40 years of age and older without a self-reported history of age-related macular degeneration or prior refractive surgery who had undergone frequency doubling technology perimetric testing. METHODS: Frequency doubling technology perimetry was performed in both eyes. Results from the better eye were used to categorize subjects as normal or having mild, moderate, or severe visual field loss. Subjects completed surveys about their visual and physical functioning ability. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Disability pertaining to 6 vision-related activities, 2 visual function questions, and 5 physical functioning domains. RESULTS: Eighty-one percent of subjects had normal visual fields and 10%, 7%, and 2% demonstrated mild, moderate, and severe visual field defects, respectively. Subjects with greater severity of visual field defects had greater difficulty with vision-related activities. Subjects with severe visual field defects demonstrated the greatest odds of difficulty with all 6 activities. The 2 activities impacted most adversely were daytime driving in familiar places (odds ratio [OR], 12.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.1-25.1) and noticing objects off to the side when walking (OR, 7.7; 95% CI, 4.7-12.7). Subjects with severe visual field defects had greater odds of worrying about eyesight (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 2.0-5.8) and being limited by vision in the time spent on daily activities (OR, 5.1; 95% CI, 3.0-8.5). Subjects with severe visual field defects demonstrated the greatest odds of difficulty with 3 physical function domains, including activities of daily living (OR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.37-4.38), instrumental activities of daily living (OR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.37-4.38), as well as leisure and social activities (OR, 3.29; 95% CI, 1.87-5.77). CONCLUSIONS: Greater severity of visual field abnormality was associated with significantly greater odds of disability with vision-related function and physical function. These findings support the necessity of routine screening to find those who may benefit from therapy to prevent progressive glaucomatous vision loss.","2014-03","2019-03-21 19:57:27","2019-03-21 19:57:27","","733-40","","3","121","","Ophthalmology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","24342021","NLM","","","","/Users/domusc/Zotero/storage/2LFKUD4E/Qiu et al. - 2014 - Association between visual field defects and quali.pdf","","*Visual Fields; Humans; Middle Aged; United States; Female; Male; Prevalence; Cross-Sectional Studies; Sickness Impact Profile; Activities of Daily Living; Nutrition Surveys; Quality of Life/*psychology; Disability Evaluation; *Visual Field Tests; Glaucoma/diagnosis/epidemiology; Vision Disorders/classification/*psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: A population-based, prevalence study of eye disease in Latinos 40 years and older residing in La Puente, California (Los Angeles Latino Eye Study [LALES]). PARTICIPANTS: Six thousand three hundred fifty-seven Latinos 40 years and older from 6 census tracts in La Puente. METHODS: All participants completed a standardized interview, including the NEI-VFQ-25 to measure visual functioning, and a detailed eye examination. Two definitions of visual impairment were used: (1) presenting binocular distance VA of 20/40 or worse and (2) presenting binocular distance VA worse than 20/40. Analysis of variance was used to determine any systematic differences in mean NEI-VFQ-25 scores by visual impairment. Regression analyses were completed (1) to determine the association of age, gender, number of systemic comorbidities, depression, and VA with self-reported visual function and (2) to estimate a visual impairment-related difference for each subscale based on differences in VA. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The NEI-VFQ-25 scores in persons with visual impairment. RESULTS: Of the 5287 LALES participants with complete NEI-VFQ-25 data, 6.3% (including 20/40) and 4.2% (excluding 20/40) were visually impaired. In the visually impaired participants, the NEI-VFQ-25 subscale scores ranged from 46.2 (General Health) to 93.8 (Color Vision). In the regression model, only VA, depression, and number of comorbidities were significantly associated with all subscale scores (R(2) ranged from 0.09 for Ocular Pain to 0.33 for the composite score). For 9 of 11 subscales, a 5-point change was equivalent to a 1- or 2-line difference in VA. Relationships were similar regardless of the definition of visual impairment. CONCLUSION: In this population-based study of Latinos, the NEI-VFQ-25 was sensitive to differences in VA. A 5-point difference on the NEI-VFQ-25 seems to be a minimal criterion for a visual impairment-related difference. Self-reported visual function is essentially unchanged if the definition of visual impairment includes or excludes a VA of 20/40.","2004-06","2019-03-21 19:55:06","2019-03-21 19:55:06","","1141-9","","6","111","","","","","","","","","","","","","","15177964","","","","","/Users/domusc/Zotero/storage/9D9ER3UL/Globe et al. - 2004 - The impact of visual impairment on self-reported v.pdf","","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Hispanic Americans/*ethnology; Humans; Los Angeles/epidemiology; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Self Disclosure; Sickness Impact Profile; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vision Disorders/*ethnology/*physiopathology; Vision, Binocular/*physiology; Visual Acuity/*physiology; Visually Impaired Persons/*statistics & numerical data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort study of persons with 1 of 5 chronic eye diseases or low vision who were scheduled for nonurgent visits in ophthalmology practices and a reference sample of persons without eye disease. SETTING: Eleven university-based ophthalmology practices and the NEI Clinical Center. PATIENTS: Eligible participants had to have 1 of the following eye conditions: age-related cataracts, age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, primary open-angle glaucoma, cytomegalovirus retinitis, or low vision from any cause. Seven of the 12 sites also enrolled persons in a reference sample. Reference sample participants had no evidence of underlying eye disease but were scheduled for either screening eye examinations or correction of refractive error. All eligible persons had to be 21 years or older, English speaking, and cognitively able to give informed consent and participate in a health status interview. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: To provide the data needed to create the NEI VFQ-25, all subjects completed an interview that included the 51-item NEI VFQ. Estimates of internal consistency indicate that the subscales of the NEI VFQ-25 are reliable. The validity of the NEI VFQ-25 is supported by high correlations between the short- and long-form versions of the measure, observed between-group differences in scores for persons with different eye diseases of varying severity, and the moderate-to-high correlations between the NEI VFQ-25 subscales that have the most to do with central vision and measured visual acuity. CONCLUSIONS: The reliability and validity of the NEI VFQ-25 are comparable to those of the 51-item NEI VFQ field test version of the survey. This shorter version will be more feasible in settings such as clinical trials where interview length is a critical consideration. In addition, preliminary analyses indicate that the psychometric properties of the NEI VFQ-25 are robust for the eye conditions studied; this suggests that the measure will provide reproducible and valid data when used across multiple conditions of varying severity.","2001-07","2019-03-21 19:54:53","2019-03-21 19:54:53","","1050-8","","7","119","","Archives of ophthalmology (Chicago, Ill. : 1960)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","11448327","NLM","","","","/Users/domusc/Zotero/storage/MCAZCKQJ/Mangione et al. - 2001 - Development of the 25-item National Eye Institute .pdf","","*Sickness Impact Profile; *Surveys and Questionnaires; Chronic Disease; Cohort Studies; Eye Diseases/physiopathology; Health Surveys; Humans; Middle Aged; National Institutes of Health (U.S.); Ophthalmology; Prospective Studies; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; United States; Vision, Low/physiopathology; Visual Acuity/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Population-based cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred thirteen participants with OAG and 2821 participants without glaucoma or VF loss. METHODS: Participants in the LALES-a population-based prevalence study of eye disease in Latinos 40 years and older, residing in Los Angeles, California-underwent a detailed eye examination including an assessment of their VF using the Humphrey Automated Field Analyzer (Swedish interactive thresholding algorithm Standard 24-2). Open-angle glaucoma was determined by clinical examination. Mean deviation scores were used to assess severity of VF loss. Health-related QOL was assessed by the Medical Outcomes Study 12-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12) and 25-item National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ-25). Linear regression and analysis of covariance were used to assess the relationship between HRQOL scores and VF loss after adjusting for sociodemographic variables and visual acuity. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The 25-item NEI-VFQ and SF-12 scores. RESULTS: A trend of worse NEI-VFQ-25 scores for most subscales was observed with worse VF loss (using both monocular and calculated binocular data). Open-angle glaucoma participants with VF loss had lower scores than participants with no VF loss. This association was also present in participants who were previously undiagnosed and untreated for OAG (N = 160). Participants with any central VF loss had lower NEI-VFQ-25 scores than those with unilateral or bilateral peripheral VF loss. There was no significant impact of severity or location of VF loss on SF-12 scores. CONCLUSION: Greater severity of VF loss in persons with OAG impacts vision-related QOL. This impact was present in persons who were previously unaware that they had glaucoma. Prevention of VF loss in persons with glaucoma is likely to reduce loss of vision-related QOL.","2008-06","2019-03-21 19:55:47","2019-03-21 19:55:47","","941-948.e1","","6","115","","Ophthalmology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","17997485","NLM","","","","/Users/domusc/Zotero/storage/GTWHP8P9/McKean-Cowdin et al. - 2008 - Impact of visual field loss on health-related qual.pdf","","*Visual Fields; Adult; Humans; Middle Aged; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Male; Cross-Sectional Studies; Sickness Impact Profile; Surveys and Questionnaires; *Health Status; Visual Acuity/physiology; Quality of Life/*psychology; Visually Impaired Persons/*psychology; Hispanic Americans/*ethnology; Los Angeles/epidemiology; Glaucoma, Open-Angle/ethnology/*psychology; Vision Disorders/ethnology/*psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: One thousand one hundred sixty individuals who participated in the fourth round of the Salisbury Eye Evaluation study and who did not have visual acuity worse than 20/40 due to a primary cause other than glaucoma. METHODS: Glaucoma was assessed using optic nerve head appearance, visual field (VF) testing, gonioscopy, and physician opinion. Vision-related quality of life was assessed using the Activities of Daily Vision Scale (ADVS), whose scores were trichotomized into the following categories: the least difficulty with visual tasks, some difficulty, and the most difficulty. Data on confounders were collected by questionnaire and clinical examination. Multinomial logistic regression was used to adjust for demographic and health factors. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Reported difficulty on the ADVS. RESULTS: Individuals with bilateral glaucoma were more likely to report the most difficulty on the ADVS than those without glaucoma (odds ratio [OR], 3.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.56-6.76), whereas those with unilateral glaucoma were not more likely to report the most difficulty (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.38-2.91). Worse binocular VF scores were associated with increased odds of the most difficulty on the ADVS after adjusting for acuity and contrast sensitivity (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.29-1.85). CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with bilateral glaucoma reported more difficulty on the ADVS than those without glaucoma. This finding, in conjunction with findings demonstrating decreased mobility in patients with bilateral glaucoma, points to the fact that glaucoma affects the report of difficulty with a variety of visual tasks.","2008-02","2019-03-21 19:55:42","2019-03-21 19:55:42","","233-8","","2","115","","Ophthalmology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","17655930","NLM","","","","/Users/domusc/Zotero/storage/54UUYUPR/Freeman et al. - 2008 - Glaucoma and quality of life the Salisbury Eye Ev.pdf","","Humans; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Contrast Sensitivity/physiology; Female; Male; Visual Field Tests; Cross-Sectional Studies; *Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires; Visual Fields/*physiology; Visual Acuity/physiology; Glaucoma, Open-Angle/*physiopathology; *Activities of Daily Living; Maryland; Vision Disorders/*physiopathology; Optic Disk/pathology; Optic Nerve Diseases/physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Population-based cross-sectional study. METHODS: Participants in the Los Angeles Latino Eye Study (LALES) underwent a comprehensive ophthalmic examination including visual field testing by the Humphrey Automated Field Analyzer II (Swedish Interactive Thresholding Algorithm [SITA] Standard 24-2) [Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, California, USA]. Mean deviation (MD) scores were used to determine severity of VFL both as a continuous variable and stratified by severity: no VFL (MD >or= -2 decibels [dB]), mild VFL (-6 dB < MD < -2 dB), and moderate to severe VFL (MD < -6 dB). HRQOL was assessed by the Medical Outcomes Study 12-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12) and the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ-25).

Persons with VFL had the greatest difficulty with driving activities, dependency, mental health, distance vision, and peripheral vision. CONCLUSIONS: HRQOL is diminished even in persons with relatively mild VFL on the basis of MD scores. Prevention and management of persons with VFL may be important in preventing or reducing poor HRQOL related to difficulties in driving, distance and peripheral vision activities, and a sense of dependency.","2007-06","2019-03-21 19:55:38","2019-03-21 19:55:38","","1013-23","","6","143","","American journal of ophthalmology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","17399676","NLM","","","","/Users/domusc/Zotero/storage/8HLWIN8Y/McKean-Cowdin et al. - 2007 - Severity of visual field loss and health-related q.pdf","","*Visual Fields; Adult; Humans; Middle Aged; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Male; Visual Field Tests; Cross-Sectional Studies; Sickness Impact Profile; Surveys and Questionnaires; *Severity of Illness Index; Health Status; Quality of Life/*psychology; Visually Impaired Persons/*psychology; Los Angeles/epidemiology; Vision Disorders/ethnology/*psychology; Hispanic Americans/ethnology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This project identifies what types of visual function loss are associated with subsequent driving modifications. METHODS: Data were used from the baseline and 2-year follow-up rounds of the Salisbury Eye Evaluation project, a cohort study of 2520 older adults. Measures of visual function tested were visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, visual fields, and glare sensitivity. Driving information was self-reported. Among drivers at baseline who continued to drive at follow-up, multiple logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of incident driving modification by visual function status. RESULTS: Worse baseline scores in acuity, contrast sensitivity, and central and lower peripheral visual fields were individually associated with an increased odds of reduced mileage 2 years later (linear trend P < 0.05). Worse baseline scores in contrast sensitivity and central and lower peripheral visual fields were individually associated with a greater odds of cessation of night driving 2 years later, whereas worse baseline acuity scores were associated with an increased odds of cessation of driving in an unfamiliar areas 2 years later (linear trend P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Older drivers with worse visual function were more likely to modify their driving by reducing mileage and avoiding high-risk driving situations.

Vision-targeted and generic health status were assessed across 5 glaucoma treatment categories and a normal reference group from 5 tertiary care ophthalmology practices during regularly scheduled eye care visits. The sample consisted of 147 patients who were members of specific glaucoma treatment categories and 44 reference group patients. For patients with glaucoma, eligibility included a diagnosis of glaucoma at least 1 year prior to enrollment and no evidence of other eye disease. Participants completed 2 vision-targeted surveys, the National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire and the VF-14, and a generic health-related quality of life measure, the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form. Data from automated perimetry (Humphrey Field Analyzer 24-2, Humphrey Instruments, San Leandro, Calif) were used to generate Advanced Glaucoma Intervention Study scores for all participants. The Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form scores from glaucoma and reference group participants collected on a random half of the sample were similar. However, comparisons of the vision-targeted surveys demonstrated significant mean differences on 7 of 11 National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire scales, and a trend toward significant differences for the VF-14 (P < .07 by linear regression). Greater visual field defects in the better eye were significantly associated with poorer National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire scores (P < .05), as well as with worse VF-14 scores. These findings were most dramatic for patients with the most severe field loss in the better eye. Vision-targeted questionnaires were more sensitive than a generic health-related quality of life measure to differences between glaucoma and normal reference participants. Our findings indicate that self-reports of vision-targeted health-related quality of life are sensitive to visual field loss and may be useful in tandem with the clinical examination to fully understand outcomes of treatment for glaucoma.","1997-06","2019-03-21 19:54:39","2019-03-21 19:54:39","","777-84","","6","115","","Archives of ophthalmology (Chicago, Ill. : 1960)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","9194730","NLM","","","","/Users/domusc/Zotero/storage/ALME6JKY/Gutierrez et al. - 1997 - Influence of glaucomatous visual field loss on hea.pdf","","*Visual Fields; Adult; Humans; Middle Aged; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; *Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires; *Health Status; Multivariate Analysis; Sensitivity and Specificity; Glaucoma/*physiopathology; Prospective Studies; Models, Theoretical","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: Three thousand one hundred seventy-five Los Angles Latino Eye Study participants. METHODS: Objective measures of VF and visual acuity and self-reported HRQoL were collected at baseline and at the 4-year follow-up. Analysis of covariance was used to evaluate mean differences in change of HRQoL across severity levels of change in VF and to test for effect modification by covariates. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: General and vision-specific HRQoL. RESULTS: Of 3175 participants, 1430 (45%) showed a change in VF (>/=1 decibel [dB]) and 1715 (54%) reported a clinically important change (>/=5 points) in vision-specific HRQoL. Progressive worsening and improvement in the VF were associated with increasing losses and gains in vision-specific HRQoL for the composite score and 10 of its 11 subscales (all P(trend)<0.05). Losses in VF of more than 5 dB and gains of more than 3 dB were associated with clinically meaningful losses and gains in vision-specific HRQoL, respectively. Areas of vision-specific HRQoL most affected by greater losses in VF were driving, dependency, role-functioning, and mental health. The effect of change in VF (loss or gain) on mean change in vision-specific HRQoL varied by level of baseline vision loss (in VF, visual acuity, or both) and by change in visual acuity (all P(interaction)<0.05). Those with moderate or severe VF loss at baseline and with a more than 5 dB loss in VF during the study period had a mean loss of vision-specific HRQoL of 11.3 points, whereas those with no VF loss at baseline had a mean loss of 0.97 points. Similarly, with a more than 5 dB loss in VF and baseline visual acuity impairment (mild or severe), there was a loss in vision-specific HRQoL of 10.5 points, whereas with no visual acuity impairment at baseline, there was a loss of vision-specific HRQoL of 3.7 points. CONCLUSIONS: Both losses and gains in VF produce clinically meaningful changes in vision-specific HRQoL. In the presence of pre-existing vision loss (VF and visual acuity), similar levels of VF change produce greater losses in QOL.","2011-07","2019-03-21 19:56:27","2019-03-21 19:56:27","","1310-7","","7","118","","","","","","","","","","","","","","21458074","","","","","","","*Visual Fields; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Follow-Up Studies; Severity of Illness Index; *Quality of Life; Visual Acuity; *Health Status; Cohort Studies; Prospective Studies; *Hispanic Americans; Los Angeles/ethnology; Vision Disorders/ethnology/*physiopathology/*psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Population-based, prospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: A population-based sample of 3203 adult Latinos. METHODS: Baseline presenting binocular central distance acuity was measured and impairment was classified as mild (20/40-20/63) or moderate/severe (<or=20/80). Peripheral visual impairment was classified as mild (-6 dB < mean deviation < -2 dB in worse eye), moderate/severe (mean deviation <or=-6 dB in worse eye). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Falls and falls with injury in the past 12 months were assessed by self-report at the 4-year follow-up visit. RESULTS: Out of 3203 individuals, 19% reported falls and 10% falls with injury 4 years after the baseline examination; participants with falls were more likely to be >or=60 years of age, be female, report lower income, have >2 comorbidities, report alcohol use, report wearing bifocal glasses, and report obesity. Among those who reported falls, 7% had CVI (visual acuity >20/40) compared with 4% who did not report falls; and 49% had PVI (mean deviation < -2 dB) compared with 39% of those who did not report falls (both P<0.0001). After adjusting for confounders, moderate to severe CVI and PVI were associated with increased risk for falls (odds ratio [OR], 2.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-5.45; P(trend) = 0.04; and OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.06-1.91l P(trend) = 0.01, respectively) and with falls with injury (OR, 2.76; 95% CI, 1.10-7.02; P(value) = 0.03; and OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 0.94-2.05 P(trend) = 0.04, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Both CVI and PVI were independently associated with increased risk for falls and falls with injury 4 years after the initial examination in a dose-response manner. Although vision-related interventions for preventing falls have mainly focused on correcting CVI, this study suggests that targeting both central and peripheral components may be necessary to effectively reduce rates of falls and falls with injury related to vision loss.","2010-02","2019-03-21 19:56:13","2019-03-21 19:56:13","","199-206.e1","","2","117","","Ophthalmology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","20031225","NLM","","","","","","Adult; Humans; Middle Aged; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Male; Follow-Up Studies; Surveys and Questionnaires; Visual Acuity; Risk Factors; Prospective Studies; Accidental Falls/*statistics & numerical data; Visually Impaired Persons/*statistics & numerical data; Hispanic Americans/*ethnology; Los Angeles/epidemiology; Vision Disorders/*complications; Wounds and Injuries/*epidemiology/etiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Salisbury Eye Evaluation","Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science","","0146-0404","","","PURPOSE: To report on the usefulness of the Activities of Daily Vision Scale (ADVS) questionnaire for assessing visual functioning, a population-based sample of elderly Americans. METHODS: The ADVS questionnaire was administered to a population-based sample of 2520 community-dwelling individuals 65 to 84 years of age in Salisbury, MD. Items and subscales were evaluated for internal consistency, item discrimination, and content validity. Published subscale groupings and item associations in our population were compared for coherence using correlation, factor, and cluster analyses. Whole-sample and race- and gender-specific analyses were conducted. External validity was explored by regressing ADVS scores on standard psychophysical vision measures. RESULTS: ADVS scores were skewed to high visual functioning levels; approximately 60% of the population had function scores of 95 or better (of a possible 100). The overall, night driving, and near vision scales were internally consistent and had strong item-subscale associations; the day driving and glare subscales were not acceptable regarding these properties. The far vision subscale was acceptably scalable but only weakly differentiated from the other subscales. Overall, night driving, near vision, and far vision scores were all statistically and independently associated with multiple psychophysical vision measures. Findings were consistent across race and gender subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: As assessed by the ADVS, reported visual functioning is high in our representative older population. The overall scale and selected subscales effectively distinguish persons along a spectrum of ability. They correlate with measures of visual impairment in a reasonable way and thus hold promise for risk factor investigations. The published day driving and glare subscales should be examined for relevance and consistency before being applied in population-based settings. Methods specific to population-based settings should be investigated for their ability to better elicit additional visual function dimensions and early visual disability.","1999-02","2019-10-14 17:05:05","2019-10-14 17:05:15","","280-288","","2","40","","Invest.

METHODS: Community-dwelling residents (n = 2520) of Salisbury, MD, between the ages of 65 and 84 were recruited for the study. Visual acuity under normal and low luminance, contrast and glare sensitivity, stereoacuity, and visual fields were measured. Subjective physical disability was assessed with the Activities of Daily Vision Scale (ADVS). RESULTS: In multiple regression analyses adjusted for demographic factors, cognitive status, depression, and number of comorbid medical conditions, each of the vision tests except low luminance acuity was independently associated with lower ADVS scores. The analyses indicate that a factor of 2 reduction in visual acuity or contrast sensitivity, comparable with that observed in mild to moderate lens opacity, was associated with a three- to fivefold odds of reporting difficulty with daily tasks. Although age alone was a significant risk factor for disability, it was not associated with overall ADVS score, once visual impairment and other chronic medical conditions were taken into account. CONCLUSIONS: Visual acuity, contrast and glare sensitivity, stereoacuity, and visual fields are significant independent risk factors for self-reported visual disability in an older population. Visual impairment defined by acuity alone is not the only dimension of the association with subjective disability. Additional vision measures are required to understand the impact of vision loss on everyday life.","2001-01","2019-10-14 17:02:13","2019-10-14 17:02:13","","64-72","","1","42","","Invest. Ophthalmol.

METHODS: This population-based, cross-sectional study included over 6000 African Americans 40 years and older residing in and around Inglewood, California. A detailed interview and eye examination was performed on each eligible participant. The interview included an assessment of demographic, behavioral, and ocular risk factors and health-related and vision-related quality of life. The eye examination included measurements of visual acuity, intraocular pressure, visual fields; fundus and optic disc photography; a detailed anterior and posterior segment examination; and measurements of blood pressure, glycosylated hemoglobin levels, and blood glucose levels. RESULTS: The AFEDS cohort includes more than 6000 participants that have completed a home questionnaire and a comprehensive eye examination. The majority of participants were female (63%), the average (+/- standard deviation) overall age was 60.9 (+/-11.3). Participants are mostly working (40%) or retired (41%), non-smoking (57%), partial drinking (54%), and with at least some college education (38%). A trust-development recruitment strategy was refined in order to overcome challenges in study participation.

METHODS: The study included 962 black participants of the Barbados Eye Studies with known glaucoma, prior cataract surgery, visual acuity (VA) <or=20/200, or self-reported fair to poor vision and consecutive participants without these conditions. Standardized examinations and protocols were used to define OAG and lens opacities. Associations with VFQ scores were evaluated by multiple regression analyses. RESULTS: After adjustment for age, additional demographic variables, and comorbidities, the presence of OAG was significantly associated with lower scores for distance activities, mental health, and color and peripheral vision, with an overall adjusted mean difference of approximately three points in composite scores. Significantly lower scores were found with PSC opacities, with an overall adjusted mean difference of 6 points (95% CI: 3.3-8.8) for the composite score. Persons who had undergone cataract extraction without intraocular lens implantation reported generally lower scores in many domains than those with pseudophakia and those without cataract surgery, with significantly lower adjusted mean scores for distance activities, social functioning, and color vision. CONCLUSIONS: Inferior vision-related QOL was associated with OAG, PSC, and aphakic cataract surgery, as assessed by the NEI-VFQ-25 in this African-origin population.

DESIGN: Prospective, observational cohort study. METHODS: In 225 patients with glaucoma or suspected glaucoma, falls data were collected via calendars, fall location was classified through follow-up questionnaires, and steps taken at and away from home were judged by integrating data from annual week-long accelerometer and GPS trials. Main outcome measures were the association of IVF sensitivity with fall rates per year or step, stratified by location. RESULTS: Participants took more away steps than home steps (2366 vs 1524, P < .001), and differences in away vs home steps did not vary with IVF sensitivity (P = .22). A total of 57% of falls occurred at home, with each home step twice as likely to result in a fall as compared to each away step (rate ratio = 2.02, P < .001). Worse IVF sensitivity was not associated with a higher rate of home falls/year or away falls/year (P > .1 for both), but was associated with a higher rate of home falls/step (rate ratio = 1.34/5 dB worse sensitivity, P = .03) and away falls/step (rate ratio = 1.47/5 dB worse sensitivity, P = .003). CONCLUSIONS: In this glaucoma population, most falls occurred at home, and the risk of any step resulting in a fall was higher at home. Those with greater VF damage were more likely to fall for each step taken both at and away from home. Efforts such as home environmental modification should be considered in the visually impaired to prevent falls while maintaining physical activity.","2019-04","2020-06-04 02:41:36","2020-06-04 02:41:36","","169-178","","","200","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMCID: PMC6445769","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajo.2018.12.021","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Multiple linear regression analysis was used to assess the impact of IBVF deficit on VRQOL after adjusting for confounding factors. These results were compared to those of monocular visual field. RESULTS: Mean subject age was 59.4 years. The average MD of maximal sensitivity was significantly higher than that of binocular summation, the better eye, and the worse eye (-3.27, -3.78, -3.96, and -8.66 dB, respectively, P<0.001). Rasch-analyzed NEI VFQ-25 subscales and composite scores were significantly correlated with IBVF deficit. The impact that IBVF had on VRQOL was similar to that of the better eye (R of 0.431, 0.422, and 0.422 for MD of the better eye, binocular summation, and maximal sensitivity, respectively). In contrast, the worse eye showed the least correlation with VRQOL (0.363). CONCLUSIONS: The impact of IBVF on VRQOL was similar to that of the better eye irrespective of integration method. Therefore, better eye MD could be a good indicator for VRQOL.","2017-03","2020-06-04 02:41:53","2020-06-04 02:41:53","","283-291","","3","26","","Journal of glaucoma","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/ijg.0000000000000623","Humans; Middle Aged; United States; Aged; Female; Male; Visual Field Tests; *Quality of Life; Sickness Impact Profile; Visual Fields/*physiology; Regression Analysis; Vision, Binocular/*physiology; Vision Disorders/physiopathology/*psychology; Low Tension Glaucoma/*physiopathology/*psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A.","Association between rates of binocular visual field loss and vision-related quality of life in patients with glaucoma","JAMA Ophthalmol","","2168-6165","10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2013.2602","","IMPORTANCE: It is reasonable to hypothesize that for 2 patients with similar degrees of integrated binocular visual field (BVF) loss, the patient with a history of faster disease progression will report worse vision-related quality of life (VRQOL) than the patient with slowly progressing damage. However, to our knowledge, this hypothesis has not been investigated in the literature. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between binocular rates of visual field change and VRQOL in patients with glaucoma. DESIGN Observational cohort study. SETTING: Patients were recruited from the Diagnostic Innovations in Glaucoma Study and the African Descent and Glaucoma Evaluation Study. PARTICIPANTS: The study included 796 eyes of 398 patients with diagnosed or suspected glaucoma followed up from October 1, 1998, until January 31, 2012, for a mean (SD) of 7.3 (2.0) years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The VRQOL was evaluated using the 25-item National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25) at the last follow-up visit. The NEI VFQ-25 was completed for all patients during the period extending from December 1, 2009, through January 31, 2012. Integrated BVFs were calculated from the monocular fields of each patient. Linear regression of mean deviation values was used to evaluate rates of BVF change during the follow-up period. Logistic regression models were used to investigate the association between abnormal VRQOL and rates of BVF change, while adjusting for potentially confounding socioeconomic and demographic variables. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients (8.0%) had abnormal VRQOL as determined by the results of the NEI VFQ-25. Patients with abnormal VRQOL had significantly faster rates of BVF change than those with normal VRQOL (-0.18 vs -0.06 dB/y; P < .001). Rates of BVF change were significantly associated with abnormality in VRQOL (odds ratio = 1.31 per 0.1 dB/y faster; P = .04), after adjustment for confounding variables. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Patients with faster rates of BVF change were at higher risk of reporting abnormal VRQOL. Assessment of rates of BVF change may provide useful information in determining risk of functional impairment in glaucoma.","2013-04","2020-06-04 02:42:17","2020-06-04 02:42:17","","486-94","","4","131","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMCID: PMC3804264","","; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3804264/pdf/nihms515690.pdf; http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2013.2602","*Visual Fields; Humans; Middle Aged; Aged; Female; Male; Visual Field Tests; Follow-Up Studies; Intraocular Pressure; Sickness Impact Profile; Surveys and Questionnaires; Cohort Studies; Sensitivity and Specificity; Prospective Studies; Health Status; Vision Disorders/*diagnosis; *Vision, Binocular; Gonioscopy; Quality of Life/*psychology; Tonometry, Ocular; Vision, Ocular; African Americans/ethnology; Glaucoma/*diagnosis/ethnology/*psychology; Ocular Hypertension/diagnosis/ethnology/psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigated the risk factors associated with a decrease in AVF over time among participants in the Salisbury Eye Evaluation Driving Study (SEEDS). METHODS: In a longitudinal cohort of 968 individuals ages 67 to 87, demographic, medical, visual, and cognitive factors were obtained at baseline (2005-2006) and follow-up (2007-2008) using structured medical questionnaires and onsite examinations. Using the standard deviation for the difference in AVF over 2 years of 4.3 degrees , two subgroups were created: Those who lost 5 degrees or more in two years and those who had no loss (i.e., loss of 5 degrees or less, or no loss). Age-adjusted and multivariate odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for each explanatory factor were determined using logistic regression. RESULTS: The overall change in AVF was -0.34 degrees (SD = 4.32), which was a significant decline from baseline. of the population, 14% lost 5 degrees or more of AVF. The following determinants were associated with a minimum loss of 5 degrees over 2 years: female sex (OR = 1.59, P = 0.03), history of stroke (OR = 1.90, P = 0.03), depression (OR = 1.07, P = 0.02), a lower baseline Trails A and B scores (OR = 1.09, P = 0.003 and OR = 1.02, P = 0.02, respectively), and lower baseline visual acuity (OR = 1.21, P = 0.03). In addition, decline was related to a lower baseline measure of auditory attention (OR = 1.14, P = 0.007) and lower baseline visual fields in the central 20 degrees (OR = 1.24, P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Loss in AVF over time is related independently to decrements in cognition and vision. The higher odds of loss in female subjects, independent of these factors, deserves further research.","2013-03-13","2020-06-04 02:42:16","2020-06-04 02:42:16","","1839-44","","3","54","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMCID: PMC4601885","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1167/iovs.11-8874","*Automobile Driving; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging/*physiology; Attention/*physiology; Cognition Disorders/*physiopathology; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Prospective Studies; Psychomotor Performance; Risk Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vision Disorders/*physiopathology; Vision Tests; Vision, Binocular/*physiology; Visual Fields/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: A case-control study compared 96 patients diagnosed with hip fracture to a randomly selected control group of 103 patients without hip fracture. Inclusion criteria for the case group were as follows: patients aged 60 years and over with a hip fracture. Clinical assessment included visual acuity and ophthalmic examination. RESULTS: Forty-three patients with hip fracture had a visual impairment compared to only 12 patients in the control group. Visual impairment was a significant risk factor for hip fracture (OR = 6.15; 95% CI 2.98-12.69). Twenty-seven hip fracture patients had an uncorrected refractive error compared to only 15 controls (OR = 2.78; 95% CI 0.92-8.35). There was no significant difference of dense cataract between both groups (OR = 2.28; 95% CI 0.75-6.93). Fourteen hip fracture patients had a macular degeneration compared to only 8 controls (OR = 5.63; 95% CI 1.57-20.18), and 10 patients had suspicion of glaucoma compared to only 5 controls (OR = 10.65; 95% CI 2.21-51.3). CONCLUSION: Visual impairment was significantly associated with an increased risk of hip fracture in elderly people. There are many etiologies that may contribute to hip fractures, most notably refractive error, cataract, macular degeneration and glaucoma.","2014","2020-06-04 02:42:11","2020-06-04 02:42:11","","212-6","","4","52","","Ophthalmic research","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000362881","*Visually Impaired Persons; Accidental Falls; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Case-Control Studies; Female; Hip Fractures/etiology/*physiopathology; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Vision Disorders/etiology/*physiopathology; Visual Acuity/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Fifty-nine glaucoma suspect controls with normal vision and 80 glaucoma subjects with bilateral visual field (VF) loss wore a cellular tracking device during 1 week of normal activity. Location data were used to evaluate the number of daily excursions away from home as well as daily time spent away from home. RESULTS: Control and glaucoma subjects were similar in age, race, sex, employment, driving support, cognitive ability, mood, and comorbid illness (p > 0.1 for all). Better-eye VF mean deviation (MD) averaged 0.0 decibels (dB) in controls and -11.1 dB in glaucoma subjects. In multivariable models, glaucoma was associated with fewer daily excursions (beta = -0.20; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], -0.38 to -0.02) and a greater likelihood of not leaving home on a given day (odds ratio [OR], 1.82; 95% CI, 1.05 to 3.06). Each 5-dB decrement in the better-eye VF MD was associated with fewer daily excursions (beta = -0.06; 95% CI, -0.11 to -0.01) and a greater chance of not leaving home on a given day (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.47). Time spent away from home did not significantly differ between the glaucoma subjects and suspects (p = 0.18). However, each 5-dB decrement in the better-eye MD was associated with 6% less time away (95% CI, -12 to -1%). CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with glaucoma, particularly those with greater VF loss, are more home bound and travel away from home less than individuals with normal vision. Because being confined to the home environment may have detrimental effects on fitness and health, individuals with glaucoma should be considered for interventions such as orientation and mobility training to encourage safe travel away from home.","2014-02","2020-06-04 02:42:10","2020-06-04 02:42:10","","187-93","","2","91","","Optometry and vision science : official publication of the American Academy of Optometry","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMCID: PMC3960394","","; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3960394/pdf/nihms543481.pdf; http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/opx.0000000000000139","Humans; Middle Aged; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Male; Sickness Impact Profile; Visual Fields/*physiology; Visual Acuity/physiology; Quality of Life; Glaucoma/*physiopathology; Activities of Daily Living; Ocular Hypertension/*physiopathology; Vision Disorders/*physiopathology; *Travel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVE: To provide a brief overview of IRT, to review some of the critical issues associated with IRT applications, and to demonstrate the basic features of IRT with an example. METHODS: Example data come from 6,504 adolescent respondents in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health public use data set who completed to the 19-item Feelings Scale for depression. The sample was split into a development and validation sample. Scale items were calibrated in the development sample with the Graded Response Model and the results were used to construct a 10-item short form. The short form was evaluated in the validation sample by examining the correspondence between IRT scores from the short form and the original, and by comparing the proportion of respondents identified as depressed according to the original and short form observed cut scores. RESULTS: The 19 items varied in their discrimination (slope parameter range: .86-2.66), and item location parameters reflected a considerable range of depression (-.72-3.39). However, the item set is most discriminating at higher levels of depression. In the validation sample IRT scores generated from the short and long forms were correlated at .96 and the average difference in these scores was -.01. In addition, nearly 90% of the sample was classified identically as at risk or not at risk for depression using observed score cut points from the short and long forms. CONCLUSIONS: When used appropriately, IRT can be a powerful tool for questionnaire development, evaluation, and refinement, resulting in precise, valid, and relatively brief instruments that minimize response burden.","2007","2020-06-04 02:42:49","2020-06-04 02:42:49","","5-18","","","16 Suppl 1","","Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11136-007-9198-0","*Quality of Life; *Research; *Surveys and Questionnaires; Adolescent; Depression/*diagnosis; Health Surveys; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Models, Theoretical; Outcome Assessment (Health Care)/*methods; Reproducibility of Results","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

K.","Visual characteristics of elderly night drivers in the Salisbury Eye Evaluation Driving Study","Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci","","0146-0404","10.1167/iovs.12-9866","","PURPOSE: To characterize visual factors among those who continue to drive and those who restrict night driving in the elderly population. METHODS: The Salisbury Eye Evaluation Driving Study (SEEDS) is a study of vision, cognition, and driving behaviors of older drivers living in the greater Salisbury, Maryland, metropolitan area. Patients were recruited from listings in the Department of Motor Vehicle Administration. Data are reported from two visits conducted 2 years apart. Night driving was assessed using a real-time driving assessment tool, the Driving Monitor System. Night driving was defined by the presence of at least one episode of driving at night during a 5-day time period (seasonally adjusted). Participants also underwent a battery of cognitive and visual function testing including distance acuity, contrast sensitivity, and visual fields. Logistic regression was used to model factors associated with night driving. RESULTS: Complete data were available for 990 of the 1080 participants (92%) attending both visits; 41% of participants were driving at night in each visit. Those who were younger (P < 0.001), male (P < 0.001), and had better measures of cognitive (P = 0.007) and visual function were observed driving at night, whereas those who were older, female, and had poorer measures of cognitive and visual function restricted their night driving behavior. An association was observed between depressive symptoms and less night driving in females (P = 0.003). In multivariate analysis, better contrast sensitivity (odds ratio [OR] 1.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.36, P = 0.02) and visual field detection (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.00-1.47, P = 0.05) were associated with driving at night. Visual acuity was not found to be significantly related to night driving (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.95-1.18, P = 0.12). CONCLUSIONS: Restricting driving at night is a multifactorial behavior that has a vision component, notably poor contrast sensitivity, and some loss of visual fields.","2012-08-03","2020-06-04 02:42:24","2020-06-04 02:42:24","","5161-7","","9","53","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMCID: PMC4620734","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1167/iovs.12-9866","*Automobile Driving; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cognition Disorders/*physiopathology/psychology; Contrast Sensitivity/*physiology; Databases, Factual; Depressive Disorder/*physiopathology/psychology; Female; Humans; Male; Night Vision; Psychological Tests; Psychomotor Performance/*physiology; Vision Disorders/*physiopathology; Vision, Binocular/physiology; Visual Acuity/physiology; Visual Fields/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2934 adults aged 40 years or older who participated in the examination component of the 2005-2006 National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey. METHODS: Frequency-doubling technology (FDT) testing was performed in both eyes and used to categorize subjects as having no VF loss, unilateral VF loss, or bilateral VF loss. Accelerometer data were collected over 7 days of normal activity. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Steps per day and daily minutes of moderate or vigorous physical activity (MVPA). RESULTS: A total of 1468 participants (50.0%) had complete FDT and accelerometer data. Individuals without VF loss averaged 9751 steps/day and 20.8 minutes/day of MVPA, compared with 8023 steps/day and 14.5 minutes/day for subjects with unilateral VF loss (age-adjusted P = 0.11 and P = 0.51) and 6840 steps/day and 10.1 minutes/day for subjects with bilateral VF loss (age-adjusted P = 0.02 and 0.09, respectively). In multivariable models adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, and several comorbid illnesses, individuals with bilateral VF loss took 17% fewer steps per day (P < 0.01) and engaged in 30% less MVPA (P = 0.02) than individuals without VF loss. No significant difference in steps per day or MVPA was observed between individuals with unilateral VF loss and no VF loss (P > 0.05). In addition to VF loss, older age, female sex, arthritis, diabetes, congestive heart failure (CHF), and stroke were significantly associated with fewer daily steps and minutes of MVPA (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral VF loss is associated with less walking and physical activity in American adults. Patients with bilateral VF loss should be encouraged to engage safely in more physical activity.

Our report, “Cost of Vision: The Economic Burden of Vision Loss and Eye Disorders in the United States” serves to update the 2007 PBA-sponsored report “The Economic Impact of Eye Problems”.  The 2007 report has stood as the primary estimate of the economic impact of eye and vision problems since its publication, but was subject to a number of limitations that led to an underestimate of total costs, including the omission of persons younger than age 40, the lack of inclusion of a number of cost categories, and the restriction of medical costs to only four eye diseases.  The total economic burden of eye disorders and vision loss in the United States in 2013 is $139 billion.  This includes $65 billion in direct medical costs due to eye disorders and low vision.  Loss of vision among workers results in $48 billion in lost productivity per year, with another $2 billion in opportunity costs due to the need for informal care.  Long-term care attributable to vision loss accounts for another $20 billion in costs per year.  Other direct costs, including special education, screening, government assistance programs, and low vision aids and devices total $1.7 billion.  Transfer payments and tax deductions cost the government $2.5 billion, incurring approximately $1 billion in deadweight losses.  The total economic burden estimate is substantially higher than identified in the 2007 report; most of this difference is due to the inclusion of additional cost categories.  We estimated medical costs in the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) dataset using a 2-part generalized linear model with gamma distribution and log-link, controlling for double counting of costs for persons with multiple conditions. Productivity losses are based on analysis of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), while estimates of the prevalence of vision loss among the population younger than age 40 are based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. Our findings indicate that the overall cost of vision to the US economy is substantially higher than previously measured.  At $139 billion in the year 2013, vision loss and eye disorders are among the costliest conditions facing the United States, incurring a cost of $450 per person.  Annual costs for are $15,900 for persons with vision impairment and are $26,900 for persons blind.  These results, particularly the high indirect costs, indicate the need for ongoing efforts to improve diagnosis and management to prevent future eye disorders and vision loss.","2013","2020-06-04 02:42:20","2020-11-18 20:52:02","","","","","","","","","","","","NORC and Prevent Blindness America","University of Chicago","Chicago, IL","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Two hundred thirty-two participants completed the NEI VFQ-25. Rasch analysis was used to test the psychometric performance of the questionnaire and each subscale. Factor models were hypothesized and tested with confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and subsequently validated with Rasch analysis. RESULTS: For the overall scale, two rating scales had to be dichotomized and three misfitting items removed to improve fit to the Rasch model. There was evidence of multidimensionality, indicating that the scale would benefit from scale splitting. For the NEI VFQ-25 subscale structure, six of the original 12 subscales could not fit the Rasch model because of item insufficiency (fewer than two items) and the remaining six displayed poor item fit characteristics indicating that the NEI VFQ-25 does not have a viable subscale structure. CFA supported a two-factor model with visual functioning (10 items) and socioemotional (9 items) scales. Most goodness-of-fit statistics were within the recommended range of values. The factor loadings of items on their respective scales were statistically significant (P < 0.001) and ranged between 0.59 and 0.84. The two scales individually fitted the Rasch model and were found to be unidimensional with adequate psychometric characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: The native NEI VFQ-25 is a better performing instrument when split into visual functioning and socioemotional scales. These scales possess valid parameters for assessment of the impact of low vision in this population.","2010-06","2020-06-04 02:42:35","2020-06-04 02:42:35","","2878-84","","6","51","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1167/iovs.09-4494","*Sickness Impact Profile; *Surveys and Questionnaires; *Visually Impaired Persons; Aged; Disability Evaluation; Female; Health Status Indicators; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Statistical; Psychometrics; Quality of Life; Vision, Low/diagnosis/*physiopathology; Visual Acuity/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

SETTING: Flinders Medical Centre, Adelaide, Australia. METHODS: Patients from the cataract surgery waiting list self-administered and completed the 39-item NEI VFQ (NEI VFQ-39). Rasch analysis was applied, and the psychometric performance of the entire questionnaire and each subscale was tested. Instrument revision was performed in the context of Rasch analysis statistics. RESULTS: Five hundred thirty-six patients (mean age 73.8 years) completed the questionnaire. Response categories for 2 question types were not used as intended so dysfunctional categories were combined. The NEI VFQ-39 and the 25-item version (NEI VFQ-25) had good precision but evidence of multidimensionality (more than 1 construct in 1 score), questions that did not fit the construct, suboptimum targeting of item difficulty to person ability, and dysfunctional subscales (8 NEI VFQ-39; 12 NEI VFQ-25). Questions could be reorganized into 2 constructs (a visual functioning scale and a socioemotional scale) that, after misfitting questions were removed, gave valid measurement of each construct and preserved 3 subscales. Removing redundancy from these long-form subscales yielded valid short-form scales. CONCLUSIONS: Several NEI VFQ subscales were not psychometrically sound; as an overall measure, it is flawed by multidimensionality. This was repaired by segregation into visual functioning and socioemotional scales. Valid long and short forms of the scales could enhance application of the questionnaire.","2010-05","2020-06-04 02:42:34","2020-06-04 02:42:34","","718-32","","5","36","","Journal of cataract and refractive surgery","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrs.2009.11.019","*Sickness Impact Profile; *Visually Impaired Persons; Aged; Female; Humans; Male; Models, Statistical; National Eye Institute (U.S.)/*standards; Psychometrics; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires/*standards; United States; Vision, Binocular/physiology; Vision, Low/*physiopathology; Visual Acuity/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: we conducted a cross-sectional study among 537 OHT and POAG patients from seven hospitals in The Netherlands. Clinical information was obtained from medical files. Patients completed a questionnaire, containing generic HRQOL instruments (EQ-5D and Health Utilities Index mark 3), vision-specific National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire (VFQ-25), and glaucoma-specific Glaucoma Quality-of-Life questionnaire (GQL-15). The impact of visual field loss on HRQOL scores was analysed with multiple linear regression analyses. RESULTS: a relationship between mean deviation (MD) and HRQOL was found after adjusting for age, gender, visual acuity, medication side effects, laser trabeculoplasty, and glaucoma surgery. We found interaction between MD in both eyes for GQL and VFQ-25 scores. The relationship between MD and utility was non-linear, with utility only affected at MD-values below -25 dB in the better eye. Visual acuity, side effects, and glaucoma surgery independently affected HRQOL. Binocular MD and MD in the better eye had similar impacts on HRQOL, whereas MD in the worse eye had an independent effect. HRQOL was affected more by binocular defects in the inferior than in the superior hemifield. CONCLUSION: visual field loss in progressing glaucoma is independently associated with a loss in both disease-specific and generic quality-of-life. It is important to prevent progression, both in early and in advanced glaucoma, especially in patients with inferior hemifield defects and severe defects in either eye.","2010-12","2020-06-04 02:42:33","2020-06-04 02:42:33","","1759-69","","12","24","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","","","","https://www.nature.com/articles/eye2010133.pdf","Humans; Middle Aged; Aged; Female; Male; Cross-Sectional Studies; *Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vision Disorders/etiology/*physiopathology; Visual Fields/*physiology; *Health Status; Regression Analysis; Activities of Daily Living; Netherlands; Glaucoma, Open-Angle/complications/*physiopathology/surgery; Ocular Hypertension/complications/*physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: National Eye Institute 25-item Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ-25) and eye examination data were obtained from 5380 participants in the Los Angeles Latino Eye Study, a population-based prevalence study of eye disease in Latino subjects 40 years and older. We developed and contrasted 5 comorbidity measures. One-way analysis of variance was used to assess the association between comorbidity and visual impairment and self-reported visual function. Regression analyses determined the association of sociodemographic variables, clinical variables, and the best measure of comorbidity with the NEI-VFQ-25 composite score. The main outcome measure was self-reported visual function as assessed by the NEI-VFQ-25 composite score. RESULTS: On average, visual function subscale scores were lowest for those participants with the most systemic comorbid conditions (P<.05). This was more evident in participants with moderate or severe visual impairment compared with those with mild or no visual impairment (P<.05). CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported systemic comorbidities were associated with self-reported visual function. This association was greater at more severe levels of visual impairment.

DESIGN: Clinic-based cross-sectional survey. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred three patients (160 Latinos and 243 non-Latinos) recruited from general ophthalmology clinics of an urban public hospital over a 6-month period. METHODS: Structured face-to-face interviews were conducted in Spanish and English to collect data for the NEI VFQ-25 and NEI VFQ-39. We calculated the mean, standard deviation, and percentage of participants having the minimum (floor) and maximum (ceiling) possible score for each item and scale. Internal consistency reliability of the NEI VFQ-25 and NEI VFQ-39 was estimated using the Cronbach alpha and average inter-item correlation. Construct validity for the instruments was assessed by comparing scores for participants classified as having normal versus impaired visual acuity. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Instrument scales for general health; general vision; ocular pain; near activities; distance activities; vision-specific social functioning, mental health, role difficulties, and dependency; driving; color vision; and peripheral vision. RESULTS: Internal consistency reliability was significantly lower in the Spanish version than in the English version for 3 scales of the NEI VFQ-25. More importantly, 3 scales in the Spanish version manifested inadequate reliability (alpha< or =0.70), compared with only 1 inadequately reliable subscale in the English version. Reliability coefficients associated with the Spanish NEI VFQ-39 scales exceeded commonly accepted minimum standards. Comparison of reliability coefficients between Latino and non-Latino subgroups demonstrated statistically significant differences for 4 scales: Ocular Pain, Mental Health, Role Difficulties, and Dependency. In each case, the Latino group had the lower internal consistency reliability. However, only for the Ocular Pain subscale was reliability both significantly lower and inadequate (alpha<0.70). CONCLUSION: Overall performance of the NEI VFQ in Latino populations is adequate. However, in the absence of modifications to improve the reliability of specific Spanish version subscales, comparisons between Latino and non-Latino subgroups using the NEI VFQ must be interpreted with appropriate caution.","2006-08","2020-06-04 02:42:55","2020-06-04 02:42:55","","1363-71","","8","113","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ophtha.2006.01.073","*Hispanic Americans; *National Institutes of Health (U.S.); *Vision, Ocular; Adult; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dependency (Psychology); Eye; Female; Humans; Language; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Pain/physiopathology; Psychometrics/*methods; Quality of Life; Role; Surveys and Questionnaires/*standards; United States","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examined the association between visual impairment and self reported visual function in a population sample of older people in the UK. METHODS: Cross sectional study of people aged more than 75 years who initially participated in a trial of health screening. The association between 25-item National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ) scores and visual impairment (defined as an acuity of less than 6/18 in the better eye) was examined using logistic regression. RESULTS: Visual acuity and NEI-VFQ scores were obtained from 1807 participants (aged 77 to 101 years, 36% male), from 20 general practices throughout the UK. After adjustment for age, gender, practice and NEI-VFQ sub-scale scores, those complaining of poor vision in general were 4.77 times (95% CI 3.03 to 7.53) more likely to be visually impaired compared to those who did not report difficulty. Self-reported limitations with social functioning and dependency on others due to poor vision were also associated with visual impairment (odds ratios, 2.52, 95% CI 1.55 to 4.11; 1.73, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.86 respectively). Those reporting difficulties with near vision and colour vision were more likely to be visually impaired (odds ratios, 2.32, 95% CI 1.30 to 4.15; 2.25, 95% CI 1.35 to 3.73 respectively). Other NEI-VFQ sub-scale scores were unrelated to measures of acuity. Similar but weaker odds ratios were found with reduced visual acuity (defined as less than 6/12 in the better eye). Although differences in NEI-VFQ scores were small, scores were strongly associated with visual acuity, binocular status, and difference in acuity between eyes. CONCLUSION: NEI-VFQ questions regarding the quality of general vision, social functioning, visual dependency, near vision and colour vision are strongly and independently associated with an objective measure of visual impairment in an elderly population.","2006-06-09","2020-06-04 02:42:52","2020-06-04 02:42:52","","24","","","6","","BMC ophthalmology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMCID: PMC1523367","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2415-6-24","*National Institutes of Health (U.S.); *Surveys and Questionnaires; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Color Vision Defects/diagnosis; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dependency (Psychology); Geriatric Assessment/*methods; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; United States; Vision Disorders/*diagnosis; Vision, Binocular; Visual Acuity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants consisted of persons > or =55 years of age recruited from university-affiliated ophthalmology and optometry practices in Birmingham, AL who had been diagnosed with glaucoma. Medical records were abstracted to collect information on demographics, visual acuity, and visual fields. A telephone survey was conducted to obtain information on vision-specific health-related quality of life [National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25 (NEI VFQ-25)], glaucoma symptoms [Glaucoma Symptom Scale (GSS)], and cognitive status (Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire). Visual fields were used to compute a visual field defect score for each eye based on the Advanced Glaucoma Intervention Study (AGIS) scoring system. RESULTS: Mean NEI VFQ-25 subscale scores ranged from the 50s to 80s. Scores for African Americans and Whites did not differ except for the general health and ocular pain subscales for which African Americans had slightly higher scores. For both African Americans and Whites, as the AGIS score became worse in the better and/or worse eye, there was a decrease in VFQ subscale score for most VFQ subscales including general vision, distance vision, near vision, social functioning, color vision, and peripheral vision (P<0.05). AGIS scores were unrelated to the GSS subscales in African Americans; for Whites, the visual but not the nonvisual subscale was related to AGIS score. CONCLUSIONS: Scores on most subscales of the NEI VFQ-25 and the 2 subscales of the GSS are highly similar in African Americans and Whites of non-Hispanic origin who have been diagnosed with glaucoma. In addition, for both African Americans and Whites, the VFQ subscales for the most part demonstrated good construct validity with respect to the extent of visual field impairment. Results imply that the NEI VFQ-25 and the GSS are appropriate instruments for studying the personal burden of glaucoma in studies whose samples involve both African American and White adults.","2006-10","2020-06-04 02:42:51","2020-06-04 02:42:51","","414-8","","5","15","","Journal of glaucoma","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.ijg.0000212252.72207.c2","*Visual Fields; Humans; Aged; Female; Male; *Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires; Health Status Indicators; *European Continental Ancestry Group; *African Americans; Vision Disorders/*ethnology/physiopathology; Glaucoma/*ethnology/physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Blue Mountains Eye Study is a population-based longitudinal study in 3654 people aged 49 years or older resident in an area west of Sydney, Australia. Detailed eye examinations and interviews were carried out at baseline (1992-3) and after 5 years (1997-9). Information about fractures sustained during follow-up were collected by a combination of self-report and a search of hospital radiology records. After 4.7 years follow-up subjects had sustained 53 fractures of the distal forearm, 20 fractures of the proximal humerus and 33 ankle fractures. In multivariate models factors independently associated with wrist fractures in women were no vigorous exercise in the past 2 weeks (relative risk RR 0.4, 95% CI 0.2-0.9) and ever use of HRT (RR 0.4, 95% CI 0.1-1.0). Factors independently associated with ankle fractures were male sex (RR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-0.8) and visual field loss (RR 2.8, 95% CI 1.2-6.6). These findings are in keeping with other studies, and suggest that different types of osteoporotic fracture have different, if overlapping, sets of risk factors.","2002","2020-06-04 02:43:07","2020-06-04 02:43:07","","513-8","","6","13","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","","","; ","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs001980200063; http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s001980200063","Aged; Ankle Injuries/etiology; Australia/epidemiology; Female; Fractures, Bone/epidemiology/*etiology; Health Surveys; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal/*complications/epidemiology; Proportional Hazards Models; Risk Factors; Shoulder Fractures/etiology; Survival Analysis; Vision Disorders/*complications/epidemiology; Wrist Injuries/etiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: The Los Angeles Latino Eye Study is population-based and designed to assess the prevalence of visual impairment, ocular disease, and visual functioning in Latinos. Both the 25-item National Eye Institute-Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25) (self-reported visual function) and the SF-12 (health-related quality of life) were administered. A single item from the SF-12 was used to measure self-reported depression and validated against the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression measure of depression. Covariate-adjusted NEI VFQ-25 subscale scores were contrasted across the 6 response choices of the SF-12, as well as across 3 combined response categories of the SF-12 using analysis of covariance. Covariate-adjusted regression analyses assessed the contribution of self-reported depression in explaining self-reported visual function. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of the SF-12 single item with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression measure was 0.96 and 0.50, respectively. Using the 3 combined response categories of the SF-12 single item, it was found that (1) all covariate-adjusted subscales of the NEI VFQ-25 were statistically significantly different across the self-reported depression categories (P<.001) and (2) covariate-adjusted self-reported depression was a significant predictor of self-reported visual function (P<.001).

DESIGN: Analysis of cross-sectional baseline data from a randomized clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 151 adults aged 60 and older (mean age, 80 years) with advanced macular degeneration whose vision was 20/60 or worse in their better eye. METHODS: Subjects were interviewed using measures of depression, disability, and chronic medical conditions. Visual acuity was obtained. Nonparametric correlation analyses and linear regression analyses were performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-IV), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), NEI-VFQ, SIPV, and SIP. RESULTS: Of the participants, 32.5% (n = 49) met SCID-IV criteria for depressive disorder, twice the rate observed in previous studies of community-dwelling elderly. Over and above depression (GDS), visual acuity aided in prediction of the level of vision-specific disability (NEI-VFQ and SIPV). CONCLUSIONS: Depressive disorder is a significant problem for the elderly afflicted with advanced macular degeneration. Further research on psychopharmacologic and psychotherapeutic interventions for depressed AMD patients is warranted to improve depression and enhance functioning. Over and above depression, visual acuity aided in predicting vision-specific disability. Treatment strategies that teach patients to cope with vision loss should be developed and evaluated.","2001-10","2020-06-06 17:12:23","2020-06-06 17:12:23","","1893-1900; discussion 1900-1901","","10","108","","Ophthalmology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 11581068","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11581068","","Humans; Middle Aged; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Male; Prevalence; Vision Tests; Cross-Sectional Studies; Sickness Impact Profile; Surveys and Questionnaires; Visual Acuity; California; Macular Degeneration; Comorbidity; Vision Disorders; Disability Evaluation; Depressive Disorder","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Approximately half of the persons with abnormal visual fields were previously unaware of any problem with peripheral vision. Follow-up results suggested that the most common causes of visual field loss were glaucoma, retinal disorders, and cataracts. Drivers with binocular visual field loss had accident and conviction rates twice as high as those with normal visual fields. Drivers with monocular visual field loss had accident and conviction rates equivalent to those of a control group. Our results have important implications for mass visual field screening to detect eye diseases and for vision-related factors in traffic safety.","1983-03","2020-06-04 02:43:26","2020-06-04 02:43:26","","371-5","","3","101","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/; https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/article-abstract/634497","*Visual Fields; Adult; Humans; Middle Aged; United States; Aged; Adolescent; Visual Acuity; Vision Disorders/*epidemiology; *Automobile Driving; Accidents, Traffic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"2CF8IUL4","journalArticle","2011","Andrich, David","Rating scales and Rasch measurement","Expert Review of Pharmacoeconomics & Outcomes Research","","1744-8379","10.1586/erp.11.59","","Assessments with ratings in ordered categories have become ubiquitous in health, biological and social sciences. Ratings are used when a measuring instrument of the kind found in the natural sciences is not available to assess some property in terms of degree - for example, greater or smaller, better or worse, or stronger or weaker. The handling of ratings has ranged from the very elementary to the highly sophisticated. In an elementary form, and assumed in classical test theory, the ratings are scored with successive integers and treated as measurements; in a sophisticated form, and used in modern test theory, the ratings are characterized by probabilistic response models with parameters for persons and the rating categories. Within modern test theory, two paradigms, similar in many details but incompatible on crucial points, have emerged. For the purposes of this article, these are termed the statistical modeling and experimental measurement paradigms. Rather than reviewing a compendium of available methods and models for analyzing ratings in detail, the article focuses on the incompatible differences between these two paradigms, with implications for choice of model and inferences. It shows that the differences have implications for different roles for substantive researchers and psychometricians in designing instruments with rating scales. To illustrate these differences, an example is provided.","2011-10","2020-11-18 20:26:52","2020-11-18 20:26:52","","571-585","","5","11","","Expert Rev Pharmacoecon Outcomes Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 21958102","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21958102","","Humans; Models, Statistical; Muscle Tonus; Probability; Psychometrics; Research Design; Weights and Measures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
